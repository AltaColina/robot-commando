In the middle of the room is a device like a suit of armour.\r\n    Beside it is a sleeping fellow, somewhat battered around the face, in an athletic suit. After a little investigation, you find that the device on the floor is an experimental 'Amplifier Suit', designed to make its wearer almost as strong and last as a robot.",
